* When are AxolotlStates deleted?
    * periodically check identities timestamp and then
        delete AxolotlState for corresponding id_mac
* Fully integrate DataSources with AxolotlStates
    * eliminate state passing; seems so nice for testing though.
* Tests regarding prekeys 
    * create IDToken Alice ✓
    * key exchange with alice ✓
    * leave Alice's identity key on the server ✓
    * leave Alice's prekeys on the server ✓
    * key exchange with Carol ✓
    * Carol: ask for a prekey for Alice ✓
    * send and decrypt message
* main.js handlers for messages:
    * id request
    * id update
    * key exchange
    * prekey push
    * prekey pull
* Bonus system "BonuSafe"
    * Should/can blind signatures be actually used?
    * TokenStore code
    * Devise privacy preserving way to combine tokens
* Abuse prevention
    * Different way than registration?
